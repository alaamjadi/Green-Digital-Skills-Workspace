# üå± Green Digital Skills Workspace

**Welcome!** This repository documents my participation in the **[Green Digital Skills](https://greendigitalcertificate.inco-group.co/)** program, where I learned how digital technologies impact the environment and how to build solutions for a sustainable future.

## üéØ Program Focus

This initiative taught me to:

- **Audit digital carbon footprints** (e.g., energy consumption of apps, websites, and cloud systems).
- **Implement green tech practices** like low-energy coding, sustainable UX design, and eco-conscious data management.
- **Advocate for sustainability** in tech workflows, from development to deployment.

## üîç Key Learnings

- **Digital Carbon Footprint**: Measuring hidden environmental costs of data centers, network traffic, and device usage.
- **Sustainable Coding**: Writing energy-efficient algorithms and minimizing server load.
- **Green Web Practices**: Optimizing images, reducing HTTP requests, and using renewable-powered hosting.
- **Behavioral Change**: Encouraging users/teams to adopt eco-friendly digital habits (e.g., deleting unused data, limiting video streaming quality).
- **Digital Transformation**: Exploring the intersection of digital transformation and environmental responsibility.
- **Impact Tracking**: Quantifying energy savings from optimized digital workflows (e.g., reduced data storage/transfer).
- **User-Centric Design**: Balancing technical rigor with accessibility for organizations and end-users.

## üöÄ Future Vision

This workspace will evolve into actionable tools and open-source applications to:

- **Replace resource-heavy workflows** with local, energy-efficient alternatives (e.g., offline file compression).
- **Track environmental impact** of digital projects (e.g., CO2 saved via reduced data transfer/storage).
- Build **Carbon Footprint Calculators** and **Eco-Plugin Libraries** for developers.

## üåé Why This Matters

The tech industry contributes **~3-4% of global CO2 emissions** (equal to aviation!). Small changes in how we design, code, and use technology can collectively reduce this impact. By transitioning to more eco-friendly digital solutions, we can:

- **Reduce resource consumption**
- **Empower organizations and people to meet sustainability goals**

## üíª Green Digital Skills Capstone Project - Green File Compressor

The Capstone project is an opportunity to apply my new Green Digital Skills knowledge to making a change in the real world. Adopting solutions provided in the course content, consider a digital product, service, or process that I could improve to reduce its digital carbon footprint.

### **Section 1: Project Idea**

#### **`IDENTIFY:`** What I want to improve?

My project tackles the inefficiency of sharing large files. It's a free, user-friendly application for compressing images, PDFs, and videos. This local tool empowers users to reduce file size significantly without sacrificing quality. This translates to faster uploads, smoother webpage loading, and secure file sharing ‚Äì all without relying on limited online services.

#### **`ASSESS:`** What is the problem (gap)?

Existing file sharing methods often struggle with large files. Online compression tools often have usage limits, forcing users to upload and download files repeatedly until the user reaches the desired result, and raise security concerns about sensitive data. This creates a gap for a secure, local application that can reduce file size without sacrificing quality. This promotes a greener approach to file sharing by minimizing storage needs and associated energy consumption.

#### **`IMPROVE:`** How will I make it sustainable?

My project tackles the environmental impact of large files by developing a free, user-friendly application for local file compression. This application empowers users to significantly reduce the size of images, PDFs, and videos without sacrificing quality.

- **Reduced Energy Consumption:** Smaller files require less energy for storage on personal devices and servers, leading to a lower carbon footprint for online activities.
- **Minimized Data Transfer:** By enabling efficient compression locally, the application reduces the amount of data transferred during uploads and downloads, further lowering energy use associated with internet traffic.
- **User Awareness:** The user-friendly interface promotes conscious file management, encouraging people to consider file size before sharing. This fosters a more sustainable digital lifestyle.

This local application prioritizes both user needs and environmental responsibility, offering a secure and efficient solution that contributes to a greener digital world.

#### **`VISION:`** What is it about?

Have you ever wanted to send an attachment or upload a file on a website that had a size limitation? Have you ever struggled with a photo or document that was just too big to share easily? You're not alone. This frustration fueled my project, which is driven by a vision of a developer with sustainability.

Our overflowing inboxes and sluggish websites highlight a hidden cost: the environmental impact of digital clutter. By empowering users with a secure, local compression tool, we can significantly reduce file sizes, minimizing energy consumption and promoting a more sustainable digital future.

### **Section 2: Action Plan**

#### **`OBJECTIVES:`** What are the deliverables?

This project aims to deliver a free, user-friendly application for local file compression on various operating systems. Here's a breakdown of the key deliverables:

- **Functional Prototype:** A fully functional prototype of the application allowing users to compress images, PDFs, and videos.
- **Intuitive Interface:** A user-friendly interface that guides users through the compression process with clear instructions and options for customizing compression levels.
- **Offline Functionality:** The application will operate entirely offline, eliminating the need for internet connectivity and ensuring user privacy.
- **Compression Quality:** The application will offer various compression levels, allowing users to find the optimal balance between file size reduction and quality preservation.
- **Compatibility:** The application will be compatible with major operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) to ensure broad usability.

By delivering these specific features, the project aims to empower users with a robust and accessible tool to tackle the challenge of large file sizes and promote a greener digital environment.

#### **`STAKEHOLDERS:`** Who is it for?

Key stakeholders include:

- **Users:** They benefit from easy file compression.
- **Developers:** Build and maintain the application.
- **Environmental Groups:** Interested in the project's green impact.

The project impacts:

- **Internet Usage:** No more unnecessary uploads/downloads. Reduced page load time for websites.
- **Cloud Storage (Indirect):** Less storage needed for compressed files.

#### **`GAPS:`** Readiness Score Assessment (Low = 1, High = 5)
